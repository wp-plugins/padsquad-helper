This plugin works with PadSquad's Mobify.js to create a beautiful responsive mobile interface.

== Description ==

This plugin reformats the current theme if the user views the site on mobile or tablet views. It adds classes
to essential elements such as the post title and post body so that the Mobify.js can select them across all

For devs: If you have mobify preview running, you can add /?psdev to view a site mobified
